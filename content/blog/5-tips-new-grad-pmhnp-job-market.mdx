# Starting Your PMHNP Career

The transition from student to provider is exciting but daunting. As a new graduate, you might feel like you lack leverage, but the data says otherwise.

## 1. Don't Undervalue Yourself

The average starting salary for new grad PMHNPs is **$125,000**. If you are offered less than $110,000 for a full-time role, you are likely being underpaid, regardless of your location.

## 2. Residency Programs vs. Direct Hire

> "Residency programs offer lower pay (approx. $90k-$100k) but provide invaluable mentorship."

Decide what matters more to you right now: immediate earning potential or structured support?

## 3. Ask About Supervision

In states without Full Practice Authority, your collaboration agreement is critical.
*   Who is your collaborating physician?
*   Are they on-site?
*   Do you have to pay for their supervision? (Avoid this if possible!)

## 4. Negotiate "Soft" Benefits

If a clinic won't budge on salary, negotiate for:
*   Higher CME allowance (aim for $2,500+)
*   Paid licensure fees
*   Admin time (at least 4-8 hours/week)

## 5. Network Early

Join your local nurse practitioner association. Many jobs are filled via word-of-mouth before they even hit job boards.
