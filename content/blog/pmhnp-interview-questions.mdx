## Part 1: Clinical Knowledge Questions

Employers want to know: *Can you practice safely and effectively?*

### 1. "Walk me through how you would assess a patient presenting with treatment-resistant depression."
**Why they ask:** To test your knowledge of sequential treatment algorithms (STAR*D) and differential diagnosis.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "First, I would re-evaluate the primary diagnosis to rule out Bipolar II or medical causes (thyroid, anemia). I’d check adherence to current meds. Then, I would consider augmentation strategies like adding an atypical antipsychotic (e.g., Abilify) or switching medication classes, while also ensuring psychotherapy is part of the plan."

### 2. "A patient reports hearing voices telling them to hurt themselves. What is your immediate course of action?"
**Why they ask:** Assessing crisis intervention skills and safety planning.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "My immediate priority is safety. I would assess the command hallucinations' severity and the patient's intent/plan. If imminent danger exists, I would initiate an involuntary hold (5150) or voluntary hospitalization. If not, I'd create a robust safety plan involving family and potentially adjust antipsychotic medication."

### 3. "How do you handle a patient seeking benzodiazepines for anxiety who has a history of substance use disorder?"
**Why they ask:** This is a classic "drug seeking" scenario testing your boundary setting and addiction knowledge.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I approach this non-judgmentally but firmly. I would explain that given their history, benzodiazepines carry high risk. I would offer first-line evidence-based alternatives like SSRIs, buspirone, or hydroxyzine, and focus on therapy skills (CBT) for anxiety management."

### 4. "Describe your experience with long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics."
**Why they ask:** LAIs are crucial for adherence in severe mental illness (SMI) populations.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I am comfortable prescribing and administering LAIs like Invega Sustenna or Abilify Maintena. I believe they are vital for patients with a history of non-adherence, and I proactively discuss them early in treatment to normalize them."

### 5. "A 55-year-old patient on Lithium presents with tremors and confusion. What do you do?"
**Why they ask:** Testing toxicity recognition.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I would suspect Lithium toxicity immediately. I would hold the dose, order a STAT Lithium level and renal function panel, and direct the patient to the ER for medical evaluation and hydration."

### 6. "How do you approach diagnosing ADHD in adults?"
**Why they ask:** To ensure you don't over-diagnose based on subjective complaints alone.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I conduct a thorough clinical interview to establish childhood onset, often using rating scales like the ASRS. I carefully rule out mimics like anxiety, PTSD, or sleep disorders, and I typically request collateral information from family or old school records if available."

### 7. "What is your comfort level with treating pediatric patients?"
**Why they ask:** Scope of practice check.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I am board certified as a PMHNP-BC across the lifespan, so I am trained to treat children. I am comfortable with common presentations like ADHD and anxiety, but for complex early-onset bipolar or psychosis, I typically refer to a child psychiatry specialist."

### 8. "How do you monitor metabolic risk in patients on second-generation antipsychotics?"
**Why they ask:** Adherence to best-practice monitoring guidelines (ADA/APA).
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I follow the ADA guidelines: baseline weight, BMI, glucose/A1c, and lipid panel. I repeat weight at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then quarterly; and labs annually or sooner if indicated."

### 9. "A patient has been stable on their meds for 6 months but suddenly wants to stop everything. What do you say?"
**Why they ask:** Testing motivational interviewing and patient education.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I would explore their reasons—are there side effects? Financial issues? I would validate their feelings but educate them on the high risk of relapse, proposing a slow taper if they are adamant, rather than abrupt cessation."

### 10. "Tell me about a complex clinical case you managed successfully."
**Why they ask:** To see your critical thinking in action.
**Pro Tip:** Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and pick a case where *your* intervention (med change, safety plan) made the distinct difference.

## Part 2: Behavioral & Situational Questions

Employers want to know: *Will you fit in with the team and handle stress well?*

### 11. "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague or attending physician about a treatment plan."
**Why they ask:** Conflict resolution style.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I once had a supervisor who wanted to prescribe a high dose of benzos for a geriatric patient. I respectfully raised concerns about fall risk and proposed a trial of an SSRI first, citing the Beers Criteria. We agreed on a lower dose with close monitoring."

### 12. "How do you manage your time when you are running 30 minutes behind schedule?"
**Why they ask:** Clinic flow management.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I would briefly apologize to waiting patients, perhaps asking staff to reschedule anyone who can't wait. For the current patients, I would focus on the immediate acute issue and defer non-urgent concerns to a follow-up visit."

### 13. "Describe a time you made a mistake. How did you handle it?"
**Why they ask:** Integrity and accountability.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I once sent a prescription to the wrong pharmacy. When the patient called, I owned the mistake immediately, called the correct pharmacy to transfer it, and apologized. I then double-checked the chart to ensure the correct pharmacy was listed."

### 14. "How do you handle a patient who is verbally aggressive or abusive?"
**Why they ask:** Staff safety and de-escalation skills.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I remain calm and maintain a safe distance. I set firm boundaries, stating, 'I want to help you, but I cannot do that if you are shouting.' If they persist, I would end the session and call for security/support if needed."

### 15. "What motivates you to work in this specific community/setting?"
**Why they ask:** Predicting retention & mission alignment.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I am passionate about [underserved populations/addiction medicine/etc.] because..."

### 16. "How do you handle 'drug seeking' behavior without losing therapeutic rapport?"
**Why they ask:** Empathy vs. Boundaries.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I avoid the term 'drug seeking' and view it as 'relief seeking.' I explain that I hear their pain/anxiety but that I practice based on safety data, and I cannot prescribe X, but I can offer Y and Z which are safer."

### 17. "Describe your ideal collaborative relationship with a supervising physician."
**Why they ask:** To see if you are too independent or too dependent.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I value autonomy for routine cases but appreciate having a physician available for complex consultations where I can run my thinking by them."

### 18. "How do you stay current with new psychopharmacology guidelines?"
**Why they ask:** Commitment to lifelong learning.
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I subscribe to UpToDate, read the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, and attend the annual NEI Congress."

## Part 3: Telehealth-Specific Questions

With the rise of [Telehealth Jobs](/jobs/telehealth), be ready for these:

### 19. "How do you build rapport with a patient over a screen?"
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I make experienced eye contact by looking at the camera, ensure my lighting is good, and use active listening cues like nodding more frequently to show I am engaged."

### 20. "How do you assess for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or tardive dyskinesia virtually?"
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I ask the patient to move closer to the camera, stick out their tongue, and perform activation maneuvers like finger tapping or opening their mouth wide."

### 21. "What do you do if a patient disconnects during a crisis assessment?"
**Sample Answer Framework:** "I would immediately call their backup phone number. If no answer and I suspected immediate risk, I would call local emergency services (911) for a welfare check based on their address on file."

### 22. "Are you comfortable with the technology required for EMR and e-prescribing remotely?"
**Sample Answer Framework:** "Yes, I am proficient with [Epic/Cerner/DrChrono] and troubleshooting basic Zoom/internet issues."

### 23. "Are you licensed in multiple states?"
**Sample Answer Framework:** "Currently I am licensed in [State A] and [State B], but I am willing to obtain more licenses if the role requires it."

**Sample Answer Framework:** "Ideally, I would love weekly 1-hour meetings to review cases, with ad-hoc availability for urgent questions."
